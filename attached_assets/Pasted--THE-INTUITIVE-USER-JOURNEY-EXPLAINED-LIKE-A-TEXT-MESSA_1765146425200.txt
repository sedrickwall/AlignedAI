🌿 THE INTUITIVE USER JOURNEY — EXPLAINED LIKE A TEXT MESSAGE

Below is the version that makes the app feel simple, elegant, and human.

✨ 1. “Tell me who you are.” (Identity Form)

Your journey starts with a simple conversation:

“What are your gifts?
What skills have you developed?
What interests light you up?
What passions grab your heart?”

This helps the app understand how God designed you — your gifts, your strengths, your calling.

It’s quick, joyful, and feels like self-discovery.

Outcome: The app builds your Talent Profile (Gift + Skill).

✨ 2. “Let’s find your purpose & who you want to bless.”

The app asks:

“Who do you want to help?
Who can your talent serve?”

This shifts your mindset from:

“What should I do?” → “Who can I bless?”

Outcome: Your Purpose Profile
(and it breaks poverty mindset immediately).

✨ 3. “Let’s choose your pillars — but only the ones that matter THIS season.”

Most women pick too many priorities.

The app helps you pick just 4–6 life pillars:

Faith

Family

Fitness

Income lane

Creativity

Self-care
…whatever fits YOUR season.

Outcome: Your Season Pillars (your life structure).

✨ 4. “Tell me your vision for the year — in your own words.”

You write a simple sentence or paragraph.

The app converts it into:

12-month vision

Quarterly outcomes

Monthly themes

Automatically — you don’t think, you just respond like a text.

Outcome: Your Vision Map.

✨ 5. “Let me see your capacity.” (Effortless Capacity Setup)

The app asks:

“When do you have energy?”

“When do you drain?”

“What are your fixed routines?”

“How much weekly space do you really have?”

You simply choose from options.

The app protects your time automatically.

Outcome: Your Capacity Limit (no more overwhelm).

✨ 6. “Now let’s find your fastest path to income.” (Monetization Flow)

This is NOT a heavy questionnaire — it feels like chatting with a friend.

The app asks:

“Which of your talents can bless someone today?”
“Which path is easiest right now?”
“What would you do if you needed income this month?”
“What brings peace when you pray about it?”

You answer short messages.

AI translates everything into:

Your Primary Monetization Path

A gentle 90-day plan

Weekly money actions

What to pause

What to focus on

Outcome: Your Income Pathway is clear.

✨ 7. “Here’s your weekly plan. I did the math for you.”

You don’t create the plan — the app does.

You simply confirm:

Weekly Big 5

Monetization tasks

Pillar-balanced habits

Family blocks

Self-care

Tasks you must NOT do

Outcome: Your Weekly Plan, done for you.

✨ 8. “Let’s plan your day.” (Daily Dashboard)

Each morning:

Verse of the day

Quick energy check

“What’s your season today?”

AI creates your Big 3

AI builds your time-blocks

AI tells you what NOT to do

Reset button for mental clarity

This feels like reading a morning devotional with a personal assistant.

Outcome: Your Daily Plan, done in seconds.

✨ 9. “Add a task? Let me discern if it’s worth doing.”

Task Discernment Engine:

You add a task → AI evaluates:

Does it fit your pillars?

Does it support calling & purpose?

Will it help your monetization lane?

Does it fit capacity?

Does it fit energy window?

Is it high-impact or low-impact?

Should it be today, later, or never?

You never decide alone again.

Outcome: Every task is pre-filtered for alignment + purpose.

✨ 10. “End your week with peace.” (Reflection + Sabbath)

Once per week:

What God taught you

What you want to release

What you want to carry

What blessed you

Who you blessed

Reset for next week

A gentle way to stay grounded.

Outcome: Alignment + rhythm + peace.
